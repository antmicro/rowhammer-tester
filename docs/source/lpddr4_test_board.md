LPDDR4 Test Board
:::

The LPDDR4 Test Board is a platform developed by Antmicro for testing LPDDR4 memory.
It uses the Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA (XC7K70T-FBG484).

The hardware is open and can be found on GitHub (<https://github.com/antmicro/lpddr4-test-board>).

This Test Board supports interchangeable Test Beds that can be populated with various memories.
Initially the LPDDR4 Test Board was meant to be used with [LPDDR4 Test Beds](lpddr4_test_bed.md).
Currently it also supports [DDR5 Test Beds](ddr5_test_bed.md).

For FPGA digital design documentation for this board, refer to the [Digital design](build/lpddr4_test_board/documentation/index.rst) chapter.

## IO map

A map of on-board connectors, status LEDs, control buttons and I/O interfaces is provided in {numref}`lpddr4-test-board-interface-map` below.

* [`J3`](#lpddr4-test-board_J3) - socket for SD card

Switches and buttons:

* Power switch [`S1`](#lpddr4-test-board_S1) - slide up to power up a device, slide down to turn the device off
* FPGA programming button [`PROG_B1`](#lpddr4-test-board_PROG_B1) - push to start programming from Flash
* 4x User button ([`USR_BTN1`](#lpddr4-test-board_USR_BTN1),[`USR_BTN2`](#lpddr4-test-board_USR_BTN2),[`USR_BTN3`](#lpddr4-test-board_USR_BTN3),[`USR_BTN4`](#lpddr4-test-board_USR_BTN4)) - user-configurable buttons

LEDs:
* Power indicators ([`PWR1`](#lpddr4-test-board_PWR1), [`PWR2`](#lpddr4-test-board_PWR2), [`PWR3`](#lpddr4-test-board_PWR3), [`PWR4`](#lpddr4-test-board_PWR4), [`PWR5`](#lpddr4-test-board_PWR5), [`PWR6`](#lpddr4-test-board_PWR6)) - indicates presence of stabilized voltages: 5V, 3V3, 1V8, 1V2, 1V1, 1V0
* FPGA programming INIT [`D9`](#lpddr4-test-board_D9) - indicates current FPGA configuration state
* FPGA programming DONE [`D8`](#lpddr4-test-board_D8) - indicates completion of FPGA programming
* 5x User ([`D1`](#lpddr4-test-board_D1), [`D2`](#lpddr4-test-board_D2), [`D3`](#lpddr4-test-board_D3), [`D5`](#lpddr4-test-board_D5), [`D6`](#lpddr4-test-board_D6)) - user-configurable LEDs

## Board configuration

First insert the LPDDR4 testbed into the socket [`J9`](#lpddr4-test-board_J9) and make sure that jumpers are set in correct positions:

* the VDDQ switch ([`J7`](#lpddr4-test-board_J7)) should be set in the `1V1` position
* [`MODE1`](#lpddr4-test-board_MODE1) switch should be set in the FLASH position

Connect power supply (7-15VDC) to [`J6`](#lpddr4-test-board_J6) barrel jack.
Then connect the board's USB-C [`J1`](#lpddr4-test-board_J1) and Ethernet [`J5`](#lpddr4-test-board_J5) interfaces to your computer.
Turn on the board using power switch [`S1`](#lpddr4-test-board_S1).
Then configure the network.
There is a JTAG/FLASH jumper [`MODE1`](#lpddr4-test-board_MODE1) on the right-hand side of the board.
It defines whether the bitstream is loaded via JTAG or FLASH memory.
The bitstream will be loaded from flash memory upon device power-on or after the FPGA programming [`PROG_B1`](#lpddr4-test-board_PROG_B1) button is pressed.
