# Building Rowhammer designs

This chapter provides building instructions for synthesizing the digital design for physical DRAM testers and simulation models.

## Building and uploading the bitstreams

The bitstream building process is coordinated with a `Makefile` located in the main folder of the Rowhammer Tester repository.
Currently, 6 main targets are provided, each targeting a different DRAM type and memory form factor.
Use the tab view below to select a DRAM memory type of interest.
You will be provided with a name of the built target, building instruction and a link to the relevant hardware platform.

````{tab} LPDDR5 (IC)

This targets a single LPDDR5 IC soldered to the [LPDDR5 Test Bed](lpddr5_test_bed.md) that is installed in the [SO-DIMM DDR5 Tester](so_dimm_ddr5_tester.md).

A typical building command is:

```sh
export TARGET=sodimm_lpddr5_tester
make build TARGET_ARGS="--l2-size 256 --build --sys-clk-freq 50e6 --rw-bios --no-sdram-hw-test"
```

The target can be customized with the following build parameters
* ``--l2-size`` sets L2 cache size
* ``--sys-clk-freq`` specifies system clock frequency
* ``--no-sdram-hw-test`` disables hardware accelerated memory test

To upload the bitstream to volatile FPGA configuration RAM use:

```sh
export TARGET=sodimm_lpddr5_tester
make upload
```

To write the bitstream into non-volatile (Q)SPI Flash memory use:

```sh
export TARGET=sodimm_lpddr5_tester
make flash
```

````{tab} DDR5 (SO-DIMM)

This targets an off-the-shelf DDR5 SO-DIMMs installed on Antmicro [SO-DIMM DDR5 Tester](so_dimm_ddr5_tester.md).

export TARGET=sodimm_ddr5_tester
make build TARGET_ARGS="--l2-size 256 --build --iodelay-clk-freq 400e6 --bios-lto --rw-bios --no-sdram-hw-test"
```

The target can be customized with the following build parameters

````

````{tab} DDR5 (IC)

This configuration allows testing of a single DDR5 IC.
The hardware setup used in this scenario consists of an [LPDDR4 Tester](lpddr4_test_board.md) with a [DDR5 Test Bed](ddr5_test_bed.md)
Since DDR5 and LPDDR4 support the same VDDQ IO voltages, it is possible to use the Tester Board to interface with a single DDR5 IC.

You can build this target with:

```sh
export TARGET=ddr5_test_board
make build TARGET_ARGS="--l2-size 256 --build --iodelay-clk-freq 400e6 --bios-lto --rw-bios --no-sdram-hw-test"
```

The target can be customized with the following build parameters:
* ``--l2-size`` sets L2 cache size
* ``--no-sdram-hw-test`` disables hardware accelerated memory test

To upload the bitstream to volatile FPGA configuration RAM use:

```sh
export TARGET=ddr5_test_board
make upload
```

To write the bitstream into non-volatile (Q)SPI Flash memory use:

```sh
export TARGET=ddr5_test_board
make flash
```

````

````{tab} LPDDR4 (IC)

This targets single LPDDR4 ICs soldered to interchangeable testbeds installed on Antmicro [LPDDR4 Test Board](lpddr4_test_board.md).
You can build the target with:

```sh
export TARGET=lpddr4_test_board
make build
```

To upload the bitstream to volatile FPGA configuration RAM use:

```sh
export TARGET=lpddr4_test_board

make flash
```

````
````{tab} DDR4 (SO-DIMM)

You can build the target with:

```sh
export TARGET=zcu104
make build
```

The generated bitstream file must be named `zcu104.bit` and written to an SD card used for booting the board.
Please refer to the [Loading the bitstream](zcu104.md#loading-the-bitstream) section for more details.

````
````{tab} DDR4 (RDIMM)

This targets off-the-shelf DDR4 RDIMMs installed on Antmicro [RDIMM DDR4 Tester](rdimm_ddr4_tester.md).
You can build the target with:

```sh
export TARGET=ddr4_datacenter_test_board
make build
```

To upload the bitstream to volatile FPGA configuration RAM use:

```sh
export TARGET=ddr4_datacenter_test_board
make upload
```

````
````{tab} DDR3 (IC)
This is supported by the Digilent [Arty](arty.md) boards.
In this setup the Rowhammer Tester targets a single DDR3 IC installed on board.
For Arty A7-100T with the XC7A100TCSG324-1 FPGA use:

```sh
export TARGET=arty
make build TARGET_ARGS="--variant a7-100"
```

For Arty A7-35T with the XC7A35TICSG324-1L FPGA use:

```sh
export TARGET=arty
make build
```

To upload the bitstream to volatile FPGA configuration RAM use:

```sh
export TARGET=arty
make upload
```

To write the bitstream into non-volatile (Q)SPI Flash memory use:

```sh
export TARGET=arty
make flash
```

````

```{note}
Running `make` will generate build files without invoking Vivado.
```

The generated bitstreams are stored in the `./build/<target-name>/gateware/` folder named after the respective target name used for building.

```{note}
The FPGA configuration RAM is a volatile memory so you would need to write the generated bitstream every time you power-cycle the board or reset the configuration state of the FPGA.
The on-board FPGA will get automatically configured with a bitstream stored in the Flash memory on power-on.
Please refer to the board-specific chapters (provided along with build instructions) for further information on how to connect the board to a host PC and how to configure it for uploading the bitstream.
```

## Ethernet connection

The hardware platforms flashed with a generated bitstream can be accessed via Ethernet connection.
The board's default IP address is `192.168.100.50` and you need to ensure the board and a host PC are registered within the same subnet (so, for example, you can use `192.168.100.2/24`).

```{note}
In order to change the default IP address assigned to the board please set the `IP_ADDRESS` environment variable, rebuild the bitstream and re-upload it to the board.
```

Boards are controlled the same way for both simulation and hardware runs.
In order to communicate with the board via EtherBone, start `litex_server` with the following command:

```sh
export IP_ADDRESS=192.168.100.50  # optional, should match the one used during build
make srv
```

The build files (CSRs address list) must be up-to-date.
The build files can be re-generated with `make`.

Then, in another terminal, you can use the Python scripts provided.
*Remember to enter the Python virtual environment before running the scripts!*
Also, the `TARGET` variable should be set to load configuration for the given target.
For example, to use the `leds.py` script, run the following:

```sh
source ./venv/bin/activate
export TARGET=arty  # (or zcu104) required to load target configuration
cd rowhammer_tester/scripts/
python leds.py  # stop with Ctrl-C
```

## Packaging the bitstream

To save the bitstream and use it later or share it, use the `make pack` utility target.
It packs the files necessary to load the bitstream and run rowhammer scripts on it.
These files are:

* `build/$TARGET/gateware/$TOP.bit`
* `build/$TARGET/csr.csv`
* `build/$TARGET/defs.csv`
* `build/$TARGET/sdram_init.py`
* `build/$TARGET/litedram_settings.json`

Running `make pack` creates a zip file named, for instance, `$TARGET-$BRANCH-$COMMIT.zip`.

To use a bitstream packaged this way, run `unzip your-bitstream-file.zip`.

## Building for simulation

Select `TARGET`, generate intermediate files & run the simulation:

```sh
export TARGET=arty
make sim
```

This command will generate intermediate files & simulate them with Verilator.
After simulation has finished, a signal dump can be investigated using [gtkwave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/):

```sh
gtkwave build/$TARGET/gateware/sim.fst
```

```{warning}
To run the simulation and the rowhammer scripts on a physical board at the same time, change the ``IP_ADDRESS`` variable, otherwise the simulation can conflict with the communication with your board.
```

1. Create the TUN interface:

   ```sh
   tunctl -u $USER -t litex-sim
   ```

1. Configure the IP address of the interface:

   ```sh
   ifconfig litex-sim 192.168.100.1/24 up
   ```

1. Optionally allow network traffic on this interface:

   ```sh
   iptables -A INPUT -i litex-sim -j ACCEPT
   iptables -A OUTPUT -o litex-sim -j ACCEPT
   ```

```{note}
Typing `make ARGS="--sim"` will cause LiteX to only generate intermediate files and stop right after.
```
