Interrupt Controller
====================

This device has an ``EventManager``-based interrupt system.  Individual modules
generate `events` which are wired into a central interrupt controller.

When an interrupt occurs, you should look the interrupt number up in the CPU-
specific interrupt table and then call the relevant module.

Assigned Interrupts
-------------------

The following interrupts are assigned on this system:

+-----------+------------------------+
| Interrupt | Module                 |
+===========+========================+
| 1         | :doc:`TIMER0 <timer0>` |
+-----------+------------------------+
| 0         | :doc:`UART <uart>`     |
